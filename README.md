# ORB-SLAM2 + FeatureBooster

This project is an example of integrating **FeatureBooster** (CVPR 2023) with **ORB-SLAM2**. In addition to the model provided by FeatureBooster, we have also performed model quantization to further reduce the memory footprint and inference time, making it more efficient for real-time applications.
